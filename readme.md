**Purpose**

The purpose of this application is to tackle the issue of the rising unemployment rate in Australia by providing a centralized hub for both job seekers and employers to either find and apply for work or advertise job listings in order to find suitable staff. Jobseekers are able to filter and search through a variety of listings allowing for a larger scale job hunt operation. They are also provided with the ability to apply directly to the employer/recruitment officer enabling a much more efficient correspondence. Employers also benefit immensely as they are able to reach a wider audience of applicants, greatly improving the quality of their recruitment. Employers are able to post job listings or even contact jobseekers directly through their public profiles. We believe that our application will be an invaluable asset in uniting people who are seeking work with the businesses that need workers, with the ultimate goal of reducing the unemployment rate.
